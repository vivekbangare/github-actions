# GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository contains example workflows using GitHub Actions. GitHub Actions allows you to automate your software development workflows directly from your repositories.

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Build and Test

- **Name:** Build and Test
- **Description:** This workflow builds the project and runs the test suite.
- **Trigger:** Triggered on every push to the `main` branch.

### Workflow 2: Deploy to Production

- **Name:** Deploy to Production
- **Description:** This workflow deploys the application to the production environment.
- **Trigger:** Triggered on every push to the `main` branch if the build and test workflow passes.

## Getting Started

To start using these workflows in your own projects, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/vivekbangare/github-actions.git
   ```

- Customize the workflows to fit your project requirements. Open the .github/workflows directory and modify the workflow files to match your build, test, and deployment processes.

- Commit and push the modified workflows to your repository:
```
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "Customize workflows"
git push origin main
```

- GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflows based on the configured triggers and start executing your build, test, and deployment processes.
